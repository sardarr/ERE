# ERE


Requirements:

1)Clone all the directories and the "main_pipeline_new.py"

2)Run the Belief tagger on your txt files and copy the input data and CB tagger output in /input_txt and /belief_output directories. 
/ldc_ere contains the corresponding ERE files from the LDC data, which are used in creating the final ".best.xml" files.

For running the code from the root:

python main_pipeline_tmp.py

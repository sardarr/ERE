<post author="izzoh" datetime="2011-11-12T23:28:00" id="p1"> Hi All , I <CB>love</CB> my parents to pieces .
To <NA>cut</NA> a long story short , my dad <CB>had</CB> cancer - <CB>given</CB> 6 weeks to <NA>live</NA> .
My mum <CB>gave</CB> up work to <NA>look</NA> after him .
15 years later , my dad is <CB>in</CB> remission ( thank goodness ) back at work and my mum is now <CB>staying</CB> at home and being <CB>looked</CB> after .
Ever since I <CB>started</CB> <CB>working</CB> I have <CB>helped</CB> out .
As I <CB>feel</CB> a child <NCB>should</NCB> when they <CB>become</CB> an adult and <NA>start</NA> <NA>working</NA> .
But recently it <CB>seems</CB> to have <NCB>got</NCB> out of control and I almost <NCB>feel</NCB> like I am now the <NCB>parent</NCB> .
A part of me <CB>feels</CB> as though I <NCB>have</NCB> to <NA>make</NA> it up to my parents .
The life they <CB>could</CB> have <NA>had</NA> if my dad never <NA>became</NA> ill .
He <CB>could</CB> not <NA>work</NA> for 10 years due to how bad his body <CB>suffered</CB> .
He was alos <CB>diagnosed</CB> with a brain tumour throughout that time and <CB>survived</CB> and I am so <CB>prud</CB> of him for <CB>going</CB> back to work and for being so <CB>inspirational</CB> , and the same <CB>goes</CB> for my mum .
Anyway , I <CB>earn</CB> more then my dad by about £ 600 a month .
My mum <CB>gets</CB> working tax credits , about £ 35 a week .
My boyfriend who is <CB>studying</CB> at uni also <CB>lives</CB> with us .
The problem I <CB>have</CB> is that I <CB>feel</CB> as though I am <NCB>paying</NCB> for everything now , I always <CB>felt</CB> like I <NCB>had</NCB> to <NA>spoil</NA> my parents , <CB>feeling</CB> so lucky to still <CB>have</CB> them and I would <NA>do</NA> anything for them but now I am financially <CB>struggling</CB> and I <CB>think</CB> they <NCB>believe</NCB> my money is <NA>endless</NA> .
I was <CB>in</CB> sever debt which through hard work I am <CB>getting</CB> out of .
I am still <CB>in</CB> debt by about £ 24k .
One is a <CB>loan</CB> , the other is an <CB>overdraft</CB> and one is a credit <CB>card</CB> .
This I am <CB>managing</CB> - just about .
I <CB>took</CB> out the loan about a year ago .
I had <CB>worked</CB> hard on <CB>keeping</CB> my bank account in good order and even <CB>managed</CB> to <CB>save</CB> £ 800 !
first time ever !
The loan was originally to <NA>combine</NA> other debt and <NA>buy</NA> a new car .
But then I <CB>saw</CB> that my mum was <CB>struggling</CB> .
She <CB>has</CB> credit cards which my dad didnt <CB>know</CB> about and it would have <NA>caused</NA> worldwar 3 .
So I <CB>paid</CB> them off for her .
Silly me I didnt <CB>total</CB> how much but it was about 4 <CB>debts</CB> in total and I am <CB>sure</CB> it must have been <CB>about</CB> 5k in total .
It was <CB>on</CB> the agreement that my mum would <NA>give</NA> me £ 85 a month which was <CB>half</CB> of what she was <CB>paying</CB> the creditors .
It also <CB>stopped</CB> teh calls , letters and my mum is much more <CB>relaxed</CB> now .
But she <CB>seems</CB> to have <NCB>forgotten</NCB> HOW much I <CB>paid</CB> off as she <CB>keeps</CB> <CB>hinting</CB> that she will <ROB>stop</ROB> <ROB>giving</ROB> me the money in December .
That <CB>means</CB> she has only <CB>paid</CB> me about 9 times !
She is <CB>adament</CB> it wasnt that much and I am going to <CB>try</CB> and <NA>ask</NA> my bank for a backdated statement so I <CB>can</CB> <NA>see</NA> exactly what I have <NA>paid</NA> out .
Also , she is <CB>getting</CB> quite <CB>demanding</CB> .
I already <CB>pay</CB> the council tax , internet ( which she is <CB>on</CB> 80 % of the day ) , phone line , phone calls , sky tv and tv license .
I also <CB>pay</CB> for teh gas and electric and <CB>buy</CB> the main food shop per month .
( £ 200 in total roughly ) .
I also <CB>try</CB> and <NA>do</NA> things like by mu mum and dad shoes etc , it <CB>sounds</CB> silly but they dont <CB>do</CB> it and my mum literally <CB>ends</CB> up with holes in her leggings .
She would rather by food and I <CB>understand</CB> this as she has been <CB>brought</CB> up that <NA>spoiling</NA> yourself is <NA>done</NA> via food .
I also <CB>had</CB> to <NA>use</NA> my savings to <NA>buy</NA> a wshing machine when it <CB>broke</CB> down .
I also <CB>had</CB> to <NA>buy</NA> a new tv for the house as our old one we <CB>had</CB> for 17 years and <CB>broke</CB> .
I <CB>had</CB> to <NA>pay</NA> for curtains because our flat is <CB>old</CB> , on a corner and freezing .
I <CB>had</CB> to <NA>buy</NA> carpets because we <CB>had</CB> bare concrete floors .
I dont <CB>understand</CB> where my parents money <NA>goes</NA> !
I <CB>know</CB> they are not <CB>saving</CB> and I just cant <CB>understand</CB> !
Now my mum is almost <NCB>taking</NCB> advantage , she <CB>keep</CB> <CB>going</CB> on about our cooker which is almost on its way out and I <CB>had</CB> to <CB>keep</CB> <CB>saying</CB> I <CB>can</CB> not <NA>afford</NA> it , because I really <CB>can</CB> not right now .
She <CB>went</CB> on so much that I <CB>said</CB> I would <NA>get</NA> a ew on in February .
I am also <CB>supporting</CB> my boyfriend at the moment and I <CB>maintain</CB> a car because I <CB>need</CB> it for work . on
I just <CB>feel</CB> like she does not <NCB>understand</NCB> that I am almost <CB>supporting</CB> everyone right now .
I am <CB>25</CB> and I am <CB>worried</CB> then if I ever <NA>move</NA> out they will be completely <NA>lost</NA> ! studying
She is so <CB>sensitive</CB> that even if I don ; t <NA>eat</NA> dinner she <NA>gets</NA> in a mood and <NA>takes</NA> it personally !
I am sorry <CB>guys</CB> ..... this is just a <CB>rant</CB> really !
I just <CB>feel</CB> like I am already <NCB>tied</NCB> down with kids !

You <CB>ca</CB> n't <NA>afford</NA> it , not with £ 24k of debt round your neck !

( £ 200 in total roughly ) " How much does this <NA>come</NA> to a month ? 
If you 're <NA>paying</NA> nearly all of the running-costs of your parents ' home and they 're <CB>paying</CB> the rent/mortgage where is all the rest of their money <NA>going</NA> ? 
Mum 's <NCB>racked</NCB> up even more debts , I <CB>suspect</CB> .
